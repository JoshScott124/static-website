      <h1 class ="tv-heading-right"> Daredevil </h1>
      <h1 class="tv-heading-right2"> Stranger Things</h1>
      <p class="tv-para-right"> Daredevil is one of my favorite TV shows that i've watched in a while. It's a netflix series about Matt Murdoc, A Blind lawyer that lives in Hell's Kitchen, which is a neighbourhood in Manhatten . Despite his blindness, he is the only one that seems to be able to see the injustice and corruptness that is happening in the streets, and intends to change it. His blindness caused his other senses to increase, so he has the abilities to actually do good, and thats what he intends to do. He takes the mantle of <b>"Daredevil"</b>, and begins to clean up the streets that he once loved. While this is happening, a mysterious faction begins to appear, and Matt meets friends along the way that help him.</p>
      <p class="tv-para-right2"> Stranger Things is another great show that i watched recently. It follows the story of a group of 4 boys and their families, aswell as 11, A girl with extraordinary powers. The show takes place in Hawkins Indiana, and starts with the 4 boys playing D&D in the "leader" of the groups house - Mike. They all decide to go home, but Will, (another one of the group) dissapears on his way to his house, the story goes on from there, meeting more characters and interesting themes that arent typically seen in TV shows, especially with the fact that it starts as an innocent looking show and takes a turn into fantasy and horror. The whole story is really interesting, and the the comedy is great when applied. </p>
