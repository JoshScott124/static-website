      <p class="movies-para-right"> Cloverfield Paradox at first glance, might seem like a normal space movie. But if you've seen any of the other Cloverfield films, you will know otherwise. <br> The entire cloverfield series of movies are typically seen as confusing, but this movie (for me atleast) takes the cake for being the most confusing one, even after having it explained. The film takes place in the future, where recources are scarce, and humanity is relying on one final device to allow infinite energy - The Cloverfield Stations Particle Accelerator. The film follows the crew, and a man that is on earth at the time. The film foreshadows the twist during the starting sequences of the film, with an interview playing on a TV about the Particle Accelerator possibly bending space and time itself, ripping apart reality - which is eventually what happens, causing chaos for every time, past, present and future. Overall Great film, keeps you on your toes for the next weird thing that happens.</p>
      <p class="movies-para-right2"> One of the greatest films of all time, The original Star wars film - A New Hope. I Would usually blame puting a film as old as this on here on me being nostalgic, but this film was amazing for its time. The effects and sounds were amazing, and the story was even more so. It follows a young Luke Skywalker, who lives on a desert planet of Tatooine. Where he inadvertally comes across two droids that take him on an adventure to save a Princess from the Evil Empire. Sounds like a typical hero-saves-princess story right? Except its not a castle this time, it's a massive moon-sized base, known as the death star. They meet friends along the way, and Luke finds out more about the Jedi from his Teacher. The Next two films would then expand on the universe more, creating more lovable characters and even more ones that you dislike. The creativity and storytelling of the film makes it one of my personal favorites, even though its extremely old.</p>
