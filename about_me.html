      <h1 class="about-heading-right">About Me</h1>
      <p class="about-para-right"> Some General stuff about me - My name is Josh Scott, Born on the 30th of January 2001. I'm the youngest of my 3 siblings, with 2 brothers and 1 sister. I am currently taking a Digital media course at borders college, in which we have been taught HTML, CSS and some JS. I'm enjoying the class, and if i pass i will most likely do the next level of the course. I'm looking more into perhaps coding games in the future, but this is a great start in understanding the programming languages and will allow me to expand my options for jobs. My passtime usually goes into listening to music or playing games (which i will talk about in another page), and sometimes i do some stuff with HTML and CSS to make sure i dont forget anything. <br> <br> One of my biggest flaws, is that if i don't understand something, i will most likely just not say anything and sit doing nothing wasting time. I also can't focus unless i have music/silence, as when i hear other people talking it makes me want to look around or listen in, distracting me from my actual task. Something i do really dislike is when others either in a workplace or in college keep shouting out of turn when the Lecturer is talking, and waste time. Other than that nothing really bothers me, i tend to keep to myself and stay quiet when working unless someone needs help.
