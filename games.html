      <p class="games-para-right"> For Honor is quite an interesting game. It's fighting mechanics aren't used often, but im pretty sure has been done before. it's combat uses 3 Stances - Top, Left and Right. You would move your mouse in the direction you want to attack/defend. There are alot of other fighting mechanics in the game that i cant list, due to the amount of them being too many to count. The game takes place in a fictional world in which it asks the age old question - Who would win? Knights, Vikings or Samurai? They take it literally however, as there is 3 factions in a constant war with eachother for recourses and land. Any chance at peace gets destroyed by the puppet master - Appolyon. unknown to the factions until the end of the game, she pulls the strings from the back, forcing them to fight. The game has around 22 heroes now, thanks to its newedt expansion. But the game is amazing, and is satisfying whenever you do something cool. There is an AI vs mode that you can play if you're not fond of playing against other people, and alot of customization for each hero of the factions. </p>
      <p class="games-para-right2"> Destiny 1 was one of my favorite games of all time. So when destiny 2 was announced i, and many others were obviously excited. Only to get let down at the games launch due to bugs, issues and a lack of content to keep us interested. However it has taken a U-Turn and fixed alot of its issues, with new content added regularly and a large new expansion, things are looking up for the game. The Destiny franchise has always had a really interesting story, as alot of it is hidden and you dont know about it unless you read up on the games archives or collections of item descriptions and lore tabs on weapons. However, you learn of alot of the backstory, characters and story elements that are actually in the game but you just need to know where to look. You play as a Guardian - A Protector of the last city of earth (And slayer of gods). There are 3 main classes, and 3 classes within those classes that you can choose from freely. The gameplay is relatively simple until you reach the Raids - for only the best of the best.</p>
